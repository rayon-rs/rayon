#![allow(dead_code)]

//! The `ParallelIterator` module makes it easy to write parallel
//! programs using an iterator-style interface. To get access to all
//! the methods you want, the easiest is to write `use
//! rayon::par_iter::*;` at the top of your module, which will import
//! the various traits and methods you need.
//!
//! The submodules of this module mostly just contain implementaton
//! details of little interest to an end-user. If you'd like to read
//! the code itself, the `internal` module and `README.md` file are a
//! good place to start.
