/// Fires off a task into the Rayon threadpool in the "static" or
/// "global" scope.  Just like a standard thread, this task is not
/// tied to the current stack frame, and hence it cannot hold any
/// references other than those with `'static` lifetime. If you want
/// to spawn a task that references stack data, use [the `scope()`
/// function][scope] to create a scope.
///
/// [scope]: fn.scope.html
///
/// Since tasks spawned with this function cannot hold references into
/// the enclosing stack frame, you almost certainly want to use a
/// `move` closure as their argument (otherwise, the closure will
/// typically hold references to any variables from the enclosing
/// function that you happen to use).
///
/// This API assumes that the closure is executed purely for its
/// side-effects (i.e., it might send messages, modify data protected
/// by a mutex, or some such thing). If you want to compute a result,
/// consider `spawn_future()`.
///
/// # Panic handling
///
/// If this closure should panic, the resulting panic will be
/// propagated to the panic handler registered in the `Configuration`,
/// if any.  See [`Configuration::panic_handler()`][ph] for more
/// details.
///
/// [ph]: struct.Configuration.html#method.panic_handler
///
/// # Examples
///
/// This code creates a Rayon task that increments a global counter.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use rayon_core as rayon;
/// use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering, ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT};
///
/// static GLOBAL_COUNTER: AtomicUsize = ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT;
///
/// rayon::spawn(move || {
///     GLOBAL_COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
/// });
/// ```
