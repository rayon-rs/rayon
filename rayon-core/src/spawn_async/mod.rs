/// Fires off a task into the Rayon threadpool that will run
/// asynchronously. As this task runs asynchronously, it cannot hold
/// any references to the enclosing stack frame. Like a regular Rust
/// thread, it should always be created with a `move` closure and
/// should not hold any references (except for `&'static` references).
///
/// This API assumes that the closure is executed purely for its
/// side-effects (i.e., it might send messages, modify data protected
/// by a mutex, or some such thing). If you want to compute a result,
/// consider `spawn_future_async()`.
///
/// # Panic handling
///
/// If this closure should panic, the resulting panic will be
/// propagated to the panic handler registered in the `Configuration`,
/// if any.  See [`Configuration::panic_handler()`][ph] for more
/// details.

/// [ph]: struct.Configuration.html#method.panic_handler
///
/// # Examples
///
/// This code creates a Rayon task that increments a global counter.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use rayon_core as rayon;
/// use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering, ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT};
///
/// static GLOBAL_COUNTER: AtomicUsize = ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT;
///
/// rayon::spawn_async(move || {
///     GLOBAL_COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
/// });
