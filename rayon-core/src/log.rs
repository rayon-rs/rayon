//! Debug Logging
//!
//! To use in a debug build, set the env var `RAYON_LOG` as
//! described below.  In a release build, logs are compiled out by
//! default unless Rayon is built with `--cfg rayon_rs_log` (try
//! `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg rayon_rs_log"`).
//!
//! Note that logs are an internally debugging tool and their format
//! is considered unstable, as are the details of how to enable them.
//!
//! # Valid values for RAYON_LOG
//!
//! The `RAYON_LOG` variable can take on the following values:
//!
//! * `tail:<file>` -- dumps the last 10,000 events into the given file;
//!   useful for tracking down deadlocks
//! * `profile:<file>` -- dumps only those events needed to reconstruct how
//!   many workers are active at a given time
//! * `all:<file>` -- dumps every event to the file; useful for debugging
