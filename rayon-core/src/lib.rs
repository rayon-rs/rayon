//! ## Restricting multiple versions
//!
//! In order to ensure proper coordination between threadpools, and especially
//! to make sure there's only one global threadpool, `rayon-core` is actively
//! restricted from building multiple versions of itself into a single target.
//! You may see a build error like this in violation:
//!
//! ```text
//! error: native library `rayon-core` is being linked to by more
//! than one package, and can only be linked to by one package
//! ```
//!
//! While we strive to keep `rayon-core` semver-compatible, it's still
//! possible to arrive at this situation if different crates have overly
//! restrictive tilde or inequality requirements for `rayon-core`.  The
//! conflicting requirements will need to be resolved before the build will
//! succeed.
