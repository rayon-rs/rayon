///
/// - You have a parallel task of type `T` to perform where `T: 's`,
///   meaning that any references that `T` contains outlive the lifetime
///   `'s`.
/// - You obtain a scope handle `h` of type `H` where `H:
///   ScopeHandle<'s>`; typically this would be by invoking
///   `to_scope_handle()` on a Rayon scope (of type `Scope<'s>`) or a
///   thread-pool (in which case `'s == 'static`).
/// - You invoke `h.spawn()` to start your job(s). This may be done
///   many times.
///   - Note that `h.spawn()` is an unsafe method. You must ensure
///     that your parallel jobs have completed before moving to
///     the next step.
/// - Eventually, when all invocations are complete, you invoke
///   either `panicked()` or `ok()`.
